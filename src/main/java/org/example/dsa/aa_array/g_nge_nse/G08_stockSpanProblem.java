 * Stock span problem
 * ***************************************************************************************
 * Design an algorithm that collects daily price quotes for some stock and returns the span of that stock's price for the current day.
 * The span of the stock's price today is defined as 
 * --- the maximum number of consecutive days (starting from today and going backward) for which the stock price was less than or equal to today's price.
 * 
 * E.g. if the price of a stock over the next 7 days were [100,80,60,70,60,75,85], then the stock spans would be [1,1,1,2,1,4,6]

	 * ---NAIVE SOLUTION---
	 * --------------------
	 * Traverse the array and for each i
	 *    traverse the array from i to 0 and increment the span value of it while elements on the left side are smaller.

	 * TIME --- O(n^2)
