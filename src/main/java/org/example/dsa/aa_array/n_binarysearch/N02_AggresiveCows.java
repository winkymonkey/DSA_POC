 * Aggressive cows

 * Farmer John has built a new long barn, with N (2 <= N <= 100,000) stalls.
 * The stalls are located along a straight line at positions x1,...,xN (0 <= xi <= 1,000,000,000).
 * 
 * His C (2 <= C <= N) cows don't like this barn layout and become aggressive towards each other once put into a stall.
 * To prevent the cows from hurting each other, 
 * John wants to assign the cows to the stalls such that the minimum distance between any two of them is as large as possible.
 * What is the largest minimum distance?  
 * 
 * ***************************************************************************************
 * Input:	Barn = 17		Stalls(N) = 6 //{1, 5, 8, 11, 13, 16}		Cows(C) = 4

	 * Our objective is to adjust the cows among stalls in such a way that cows stay at maximum possible distance.
	 * and if we try to further increase the distance between cows, we will fall short of stalls.
	 * 
	 * So without thinking much, we can start by putting all cows in adjacent stalls and check whether we can accommodate all cows in all stalls or not.
	 * If yes, then we can increase their distance further and validate whether we can accommodate all cows in all stalls or not.
	 * We can keep on doing this process unless we fall short of stalls. And whenever we falls short of stalls, we can conclude that is is the optimal answer.
	 * 
	 * But considering the constraints of the number of stalls, linear search cannot be performed.
	 * Hence we need to perform binary search
	 * and the range will be 1 to 1,000,000,000
